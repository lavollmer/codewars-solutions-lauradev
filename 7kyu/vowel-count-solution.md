# Vowel Count

## Question
Return the number (count) of vowels in the given string.

We will consider a, e, i, o, u as vowels for this Kata (but not y).

The input string will only consist of lower case letters and/or spaces.


## Thought Process Laura Dev

1. Base input = only will be lower case letters or spaces. Do not need to worry about edge cases with upper case or unique symbols.
2. Consider the vowels of "a,e,i,o,u" for this kata
3. Final output is to return the NUMBER of vowels in the string
4. I want to create a loop that adds to a count variable outside the loop
5. Return the total count value of the variable

## Solution

I first began by creating a variable called totalCount and set its value equal to zero.
